# Sets##################################
# Sets are unordered collections of unique elements
# Sets are mutable
# Sets are defined by curly braces {}
#example of sets
set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # set of integers
set2 = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}  # set of strings
set3 = {1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana'}  # mixed set
set4 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # duplicate elements are removed


#access elements in a set


# add elements to a set


#remove elements from a set


#check if an element is in a set


#find the length of a set


#clear a set




#tuples##################################
# Tuples are ordered collections of elements
# Tuples are immutable
# Tuples are defined by parentheses ()
#example of tuples
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # tuple of integers
tuple2 = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')  # tuple of strings
tuple3 = (1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana')  # mixed tuple
tuple4 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # duplicate elements are allowed


#access elements in a tuple


#find the length of a tuple


#count the number of occurrences of an element in a tuple


#find the index of an element in a tuple


#convert a tuple to a list


#convert a list to a tuple

# Challenge: Count the number of occurrences of the character 'v' in the text below.
# The text is converted to a tuple of characters and the target characters are 'v' and 'V'.
# The result is output to the console.

text = """Voil√†! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate.
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation
of a by-gone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and
vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.


The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day
vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.


Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet you
and you may call me V."""


# Convert the text to a tuple of characters




# Tuple to store the target characters






# Count occurrences of 'v' or 'V' by filtering the text_tuple

# dictionarys Accessing a Value from a Nested List###############################
#Suppose we have a dictionary containing multiple lists as values, and you want to access a specific element from one of these lists.
# Define the dictionary


sample_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
# get length of the list
print(len(sample_list)) # Output: 3
#this is called a nested list
# Extract and print the second element from the first list


sample_list_of_fruit = {"fruits": ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]}
# Extract and print the second fruit from the list


sample_list_of_lists = {"lists": [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]}
# Extract and print the third element from the second list




sample_list_of_dicts = {"dicts": [{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}, {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}]}
# Extract and print the age of the second person
