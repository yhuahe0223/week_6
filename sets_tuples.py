# # Sets##################################
# # Sets are unordered collections of unique elements
# # Sets are mutable
# # Sets are defined by curly braces {}
# #example of sets
# set_1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # set of integers
# set2 = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}  # set of strings
# set3 = {1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana'}  # mixed set
# set4 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # duplicate elements are removed


# #access elements in a set
# # print (set_1(1))# WRONG no [ ]
# print(1 in set_1)# output true 
# print('apple ' in set2) #output true 

# # add elements to a set
# set_1.add(6)
# print(set_1)

# #remove elements from a set

# print(set_1.remove(6))
# print(set_1)
# #check if an element is in a set


# #find the length of a set


# #clear a set
# set_1.clear()
# print(set_1)
# set2.clear()
# print(set2)


# #tuples##################################
# # Tuples are ordered collections of elements
# # Tuples are immutable
# # Tuples are defined by parentheses ()
# #example of tuples
# tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # tuple of integers
# tuple2 = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')  # tuple of strings
# tuple3 = (1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana')  # mixed tuple
# tuple4 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # duplicate elements are allowed


# #access elements in a tuple
# print(tuple1[0])
# print(tuple2[1])
# print(tuple3[3])

# #find the length of a tuple
# print(len(tuple1))
# print(len(tuple2))


# #count the number of occurrences of an element in a tuple
# print(tuple4.count(1))
# print(tuple4.count(6))
# print(tuple3.count('apple '))


# #find the index of an element in a tuple
# print(tuple1.index(3))
# print(tuple2.index('cherry'))
# print(tuple3.index('banana'))

# #convert a tuple to a list
# print(list(tuple1))

# #convert a list to a tuple
# print(tuple(list(tuple1)))

text = """Voil√†! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate.
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation
of a by-gone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and
vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.


The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day
vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.


Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet you
and you may call me V."""
